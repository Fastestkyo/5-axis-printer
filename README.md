# 5-axis printer

this is a personal project where im building a 5-axis 3d printer, inspired by multipole’s 5-axis design. after i make the printer. i will try to add a mmu to this

normal 3d printers use 3 axes (x, y, z). a 5-axis printer adds two more rotational axes. this lets it print more complex shapes with fewer supports and smoother surfaces.  

## bill of materials (wip)

i’m keeping a list of all the parts i'm using. it’s not final yet.
